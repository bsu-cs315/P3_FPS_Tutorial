# P3_FPS_Tutorial

## Project Report
For this tutorial, there were many things that could have been changed for our adopted style guide. In this report I am just stating what some of the things that could be done to better suit or style guide. I did not actually refactor the solution to the style guide. One thing that could be done is cleaning up the spaces in between functions and if statements. There was just too much and the code was already being seperated by comments to show which section did what. Another thing that could have been changed is the function names. Majority of the function names did not start with an underscore to help clarify that they are a function. Lastly, there are places that could use colons, in order to make the code easier to read and on one page.
